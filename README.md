Verification of ECMWF Ensemble Forecasts over the Arctic Ocean

Objective: Assess the accuracy of ECMWF ensemble forecasts of sea surface latent and sensible heat fluxes in the Arctic using saildrone observations

Motivations: (1) Sea surface latent and sensible heat fluxes are critical components of the upper-ocean heat budget that is at the center of sea-ice interaction for the Arctic amplification of global warming. (2) Validation of numerical forecast of sea surface latent and sensible heat fluxes in the Arctic is extremely difficult because of very few in situ observations available there. (3) Saildrones, remotely piloted uncrewed surface vehicles, have been used to make in situ observations in the Arctic that can be used to validate numerical forecasts. 

Potential Impacts: (1) Results from this project would help improve the particular numerical model used for the ECMWF forecast, which is one of the best in the world. (2) The procedure of validating numerical model forecasts against saildrone observation developed through this project can be applied to validate other numerical models.
